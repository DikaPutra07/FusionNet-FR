# FusionNet-FR: A DualNet transformer architecture using frequency modeling and relational learning for enhanced long-term time series forecasting

This repo is the official Pytorch implementation of ["FusionNet-FR: A DualNet transformer architecture using frequency modeling and relational learning for enhanced long-term time series forecasting"].

# Usage

1. Download dataset at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2)
2. Make `/dataset/` folder at root directory
3. Copy all dataset folders to the `/dataset/` directory
4. Install package requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts for FusionNet-FR under the folder `./fusion_script/`
